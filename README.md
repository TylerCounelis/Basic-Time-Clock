## About the Project

This has been an idea in the back of my mind since mid-August 2023. I started a job being a  
teaching assistant for one of my old classes, and I was responsible for logging my own hours.  
Rather than diligently write down every start-end time, I wanted a simple button press that  
would do the job for me and save the data. This gives me the opportunity to work in a couple  
different languages and dive into some full-stack development for the first time.  

This is also the first time I've interacted with git in any capacity, so I'll be learning  
how to use that in tandem with the above.
